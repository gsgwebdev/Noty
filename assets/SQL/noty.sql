Think of your business as a franchise prototype. You should be able to hand the â€œhow-toâ€ manual to just anyone, to do it as good as you.', 'Fatal assumption : if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work.\r\nThe technical work of a business, and a business that does that technical work are two totally different things.\r\nThe technician is forced to learn how to make the business work, rather than do the work himself.\r\n\r\nEvery technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure experiences the same thing: \r\n1. Exhiliration, 2. Terror, 3. Exhaustion, 4. Despair - a terrible sense of loss, loss of special relationship with their work, loss of purpose, loss of self.\r\n\r\n\r\n== ENTREPRENEUR, MANAGER, TECHNICIAN\r\n\r\nEverybody who goes into business is actually three people in one:\r\nThe Entrepreneur dreams\r\nThe Manager frets\r\nThe Technician ruminates\r\nWhile each of these personalities wants to be the boss, none of them wants to have a boss.\r\n\r\nThe Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the present.  He''s happiest when left free to construct images of &quot;what if&quot; and &quot;if when&quot;.\r\nIn business, the Entrepreneur is the innovator, grand strategist, creator of new methods.\r\nGiven his need for change, the Entrepreneur creates a great deal of havoc around him, which is predictably unsettling for those he enlists in his projects.\r\nThe entrepreneur builds a house and the instant it''s done begins planning the next one.\r\n\r\nThe Manager craves order, compulsively clings to the status quo.  While entrepreneur sees opportunities, manager sees the problems.\r\nThe Manager creates neat orderly rows of things.  The Entrepreneur creates the things that the manager puts in rows.\r\nThe Manager is the one who runs after the Entrepreneur to clean up the mess.  Without the Entrepreneur there would be no mess to clean up.\r\n\r\nTechnician is the doer : &quot;if you want something done right, do it yourself&quot;.\r\nAs long as the Technician is working, he is happy, but only on one thing at a time.  He knows he can''t get things done simultaneously, so he works steadily and is happiest when he is in control of the work flow.\r\n\r\nIf the three were equally balanced, we''d be describing an incredibly competent individual.\r\nThe Entrepreneur would be free to forge ahead into new areas of interest.\r\nThe Manager would be solidifying the base of operations.\r\nThe Technician would be doing the technical work.\r\n\r\nWithout all three of these personalities being given opportunity, the freedom, the nourishment they each need to grow, your business cannot help but mirror your own lopsidedness.\r\n\r\nAn Entrepreneur does the work of envisioning the business as something apart from you, the owner.  The work of asking all the right questions about WHY this business, opposed to that business?\r\n\r\n\r\n== INFANCY\r\n\r\nUnfortunately most business do what the owner wants as opposed to what the business needs.\r\nIt''s easy to spot a business in infancy : the owner and business are one and the same.\r\nInfancy ends when the owner realizes the business cannot continue to run the way it has been, that to survive it will have to change.  This is where most business failures occur.\r\n\r\nIf your business depends on you, you don''t own a business - you have a job.  (and you''re working for a lunatic)\r\nThe purpose of going into business is to get free of a job so you can create jobs for other people.\r\n\r\n== ADOLESCENCE\r\n\r\nError: Management by abdication (&quot;To relinquish formally a high office or responsibility.&quot;) rather than delegation.\r\nThe process of deterioration where the number of the balls in the air is not only too much for you, but too much for your people as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n== BEYOND THE COMFORT ZONE\r\n\r\nTrue trust comes from knowing, not from blind faith.\r\nTo know, one must understand.\r\nTo understand, one must have an intimate awareness of what conditions are truly present.  What people know, do, want, are - and what they don''t/aren''t.\r\nA business that &quot;gets small again&quot; is a business reduced to the level of its owner''s personal resistance to change - its owner''s comfort zone.  (works and waits for something positive to happen)\r\nBusinesses that &quot;get small again&quot; die, implode.\r\nYour job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth.\r\nTo educate yourself so that, as your business grows, the foundation and structure can carry the additional weight.\r\n** It''s up to you to dictate your business''s rate of growth by understanding the key processes that need to be performed, the key objectives that need to be achieved, the key position you''re aiming for in the marketplace.\r\nWrite it down, clearly, so others can understand it.  (If you can''t, you don''t own it!)\r\n\r\n\r\n== MATURITY\r\n\r\nMaturity is not an inevitable result of the first two phases.  It is not the end of a serial process.  Great companies didn''t end up as mature companies - they started out that way.\r\nMature company must also go through infancy and adolescence, but go through them in a different way.  It''s the perspective that makes the difference.\r\nVery clear picture of what the company would look like when it was done.  How it would act.\r\nUnless you act that way from the beginning, you''ll never get there.  In order to become a great company, act like a great company long before it ever becomes one.\r\nEvery day at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business.  We didn''t do business at IBM, we built one.\r\nThe very best businesses are fashioned after a model of a business that works.\r\n\r\nHow must the business work?\r\nBusiness as a system for producing outside results - for the customer - resulting in profits.\r\nPicture of a well-defined future, then comes back to the present with the intention of changing it to match the vision.\r\n\r\nSurvey the world and ask, &quot;Where is the opportunity?&quot;\r\nIdentify it, then go back to the drawing board and construct a solution to the frustration found in a group of customers.\r\nActs the way the customer needs it to act, not the Entrepreneur.\r\n&quot;How will my business look to the customer?&quot;  &quot;How will my business stand out from all the rest?&quot;\r\nWithin the customer is a continuing parade of changing wants, begging to be satisfied.  Find out what those wants are, and what they will be in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n== THE TURN-KEY REVOLUTION / FRANCHISE PROTOTYPE\r\n\r\nA systems-dependent business, not a people-dependent business.\r\nIntegrity : doing what you say you will do, and if you can''t : learning how.\r\n\r\nFranchise prototype is where all assumptions are put to the test to see how well they work before becoming operational in the business.\r\nThe system runs the business.  The people run the system.\r\nThe system isn''t something you bring to the business.  It''s something you derive from the process of building the business.\r\nEntrepreneur : franchise prototype is the medium through which vision takes form in the real world.\r\nManager : franchise prototype provides the order, predictability, system.\r\nTechnician : franchise prototype is where he is free to do the things he loves to do : the technical work.\r\n\r\n\r\n== WORKING ON YOUR BUSINESS, NOT IN IT\r\n\r\nYour business is not your life.\r\nYour business is something apart from you, with its own rules and its own purposes.  An organism that will live or die according to how well it performs its sole function : find and keep customers.\r\nThe primary purpose of your business is to serve your life (not vice-versa)\r\nMake a perfect prototype for 5000 more just like it.  Exactly like it, not just similar.\r\nFranchise model:\r\n1. provides consistent value to customers, employees, etc - beyond what they expect\r\n2. operated by people with the lowest possible skill\r\n3. a place of impecable order\r\n4. all work documented in operations manuals\r\n5. provides uniformly predictable service to the customer\r\n6. uses uniform color, dress, facilities code\r\n\r\nLowest possible level of skill necessary to fulfill the functions for which each is intended.  Of course, in a legal firm you need attorneys, medical, physicians.  But you don''t need to hire brilliant attorneys or physicians.\r\nCreate the very best system through which good attorneys and good physicians can be leveraged to produce exquisite results.\r\n\r\nHow can I give my customer the results he wants systematically rather than personally?\r\nHow can I create a business whose results are systems-dependent rather than people-dependent or expert-dependent?\r\nHow can I create an expert system rather than hire one?\r\n\r\nGreat business are not built by extraordinary people, but by ordinary people doing extraordinary things.\r\n\r\nDevelop those tools and teach your people how to use them.\r\nPeople''s job is to use the tools you''ve developed and recommend improvements based on their experience with them.\r\n\r\nNO : Typical owner of a small business prefers highly skilled people because he believes they make his job easier - he can simply leave the work to them.\r\nUnfortunately then the business grows to depend on the whims and moods of its people.\r\nIf they''re in the mood, the job gets done.  If they''re not, it doesn''t.\r\nIn this kind of business, &quot;How do I motivate my people?&quot; comes up : &quot;How do I keep them in the mood?&quot;\r\nIt is literally impossible to create a consistent result in a business that depends on extraordinary people.\r\nWhen you intentionally build your business around the skills of ordinary people, you will be forced to ask the difficult questions about how to produce a result without the extraordinary ones.\r\nYou will be forced to find a system that leverages your ordinary people to the point where they can produce extraordinary results over and over again.\r\nYou will be forced to invent innovative system solutions to the people problems that plague businesses.\r\nYou will be forced to build a business that works.\r\n\r\nDocumentation says, &quot;This is how we do it here.&quot;\r\nWithout documentation, all routinized work turns into exceptions.\r\nDesignates the purpose of the work, specifies the steps needed to be taken while doing that work, and summarizes the standards associated with both the process and result.\r\n\r\nBARBER story : He was constantly  and arbitrarily changing my experience for me.  He was in control of my experience, not I.  Running the business for him, not me.  Deprived me of the experience of making a decision to patronize his business for my own reasons.  It didn''t matter what I wanted.\r\nWhat you do in your model is not as important as doing what you do the same way, each and every time.\r\n\r\n* How can I get my business to work without me?\r\n* How can I get my people to work without my interference?\r\n* How can I systematize my business so it could be replicated thousands of times?\r\n* How can I own my business, and still be free of it?\r\n* How can I spend my time doing the work I love to do rather than the work I have to do?\r\n\r\n\r\n== BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\r\n\r\nPeople constantly asking, &quot;What is the best way to do this?&quot; - knowing we''ll never discover the best way, but by asking we discover a better way.\r\nInnovation is the &quot;best way&quot; skill.  It produces a high level of energy in every company.\r\n\r\nQuantification : numbers related to the impact an innovation makes.\r\nQuantify EVERYTHING related to how you do business.\r\nEventually, you and your people will think of your entire business in terms of the numbers.\r\nRead your business'' health chart by the flow of the numbers.\r\nKnow which numbers are critical and which aren''t.\r\nBecome as familiar with your business'' numbers as a doctor is with blood pressure / pulse rates.\r\nWithout the numbers, you don''t know where you are or where you''re going.\r\nWith the numbers, your business will take on a totally new meaning.\r\n\r\nOrchestration is the elimination of discretion or choice at the operating level of your business.\r\nWithout orchestration, nothing could be planned or anticipated by you or your customer.\r\nIf you''re doing everything differently every time you do it, if everyone is doing it at their own discretion, you''re creating chaos, not order.\r\nIf you haven''t orchestrated it, you don''t own it.\r\nIf you don''t own it, you can''t depend on it.\r\nUnless your unique way of doing business can be replicated every single time, you don''t own it.\r\nUnless your customer gets everything he wants every time, he''ll go someplace else to get it.\r\nThe business development process is not static - it''s not something you do and then are done with - it''s something you do all the time.\r\n\r\nInnovation, Quantification, Orchestration are the backbone of a business - the Business Development Process.\r\n\r\n\r\n== BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\r\n\r\nYour...\r\n1. Primary Aim\r\n2. Strategic Objective\r\n3. Organizational Strategy\r\n4. Management Strategy\r\n5. People Strategy\r\n6. Marketing Strategy\r\n7. Systems Strategy\r\n\r\n== PRIMARY AIM:\r\nWhat do I value most?\r\nWhat kind of life do I want?\r\nWhat do I want my life to look like, to feel like?\r\nHow do I wish my day-to-day to be?\r\nWhat would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my life?\r\nWho do I wish to be?\r\nHow would I like to be with other people in my life : my family, friends, business associates, customers, employees?\r\nHow would I like people to think about me?\r\n2 years from now?  10?  20?  End of life?\r\nWhat specifically would I like to learn during my life : spiritually, physically, financially, technically, intellectually, about relationships?\r\n\r\nBegin living your life as if it were important.  Take it seriously.  Create it intentionally.\r\n\r\n== STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:\r\n\r\nYour strategic objective is a very clear statement of what your business has to ultimately do for you to achieve your primary aim.\r\n\r\nThe first standard is gross revenues.  How big will your company be when it''s finally done?  Know your gross profits, pretax profits, after-tax profits.\r\nYou can''t know all this, but any standards are better than no standards.\r\nDoes the business I have in mind alleviate a frustration experienced by a large enough group of consumers to make it worth my while?\r\nCentral demographic model : a most probable customer.\r\n\r\n== ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY\r\n\r\nThe organizational development reflected in the Organizational Chart can have a more profound impact on a small company than any other single business development step.\r\nMore companies organize around personalities rather than around functions.  (&amp; the result is chaos)\r\nMake a chart of positions : COO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, VP Finance, Sales manager, Advertising/Research manager, Production manager, Service manager, Facilities manager, Accounts receivable manager, Accounts payable manager.  (clear tree of who reports to who)\r\nA position contract : a summary of the results to be achieved by each position in the company, the work that position is accountable for, a list of standards by which results are to be evaluated.  Sign off on it.  Not a job description, it is a contract between the company, employee, and a summary of the rules of the game.  It provides each person with a sense of commitment and accountability.\r\n\r\nLook at each position as a franchise prototype of its own.\r\nWhen one goes to work in a position, one goes to work ON a position, implementing the business development process of innovation, quantification, orchestration.\r\n\r\nDon''t hire someone with experience.  Not a master technician.  A novice, a beginner, an apprentice.  Someone eager to learn how to do it right.  Willing to learn what you''ve spent so much time and energy discovering.  Someone who is open to the possibility of learning skills not developed yet, skills he/she wants to learn.\r\n\r\nIf you don''t obey the rules, honor them, extol them, why should you expect anyone else to take your game seriously?\r\n\r\n\r\n== MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\r\n\r\nYou may think your plan depends on highly skilled people.  It doesn''t.  You don''t need such people.  You can''t afford them.  They will become the bane of your existence.\r\nWhat you need is a mangement system.\r\nThe system will become your management strategy, and produces the results you want.\r\nThe system will become your solution to the problems of unpredictable people, by orchestrating the process by which management decisions are made, while eliminating the need for such decisions whenever possible.\r\n\r\nA management system is a system designed into your prototype to produce a marketing result.\r\nThe more automatic that system is, the more effective your franchise prototype will be.\r\nManagement development - the process through which you create your management system, and teach up-and-upcoming managers to use it, isn''t a management tool - it''s a marketing tool.\r\nIts purpose is not just to create an efficient prototype but an effective one : one that finds and keeps customers, profitably, better than any other.\r\n(HOTEL STORY HERE)\r\n\r\n\r\n== PEOPLE STRATEGY\r\n\r\n&quot;How do I get my people to do what I want?&quot;\r\nYou can''t get your people to do anything.\r\nIf you want it done, create an environment where &quot;doing it&quot; is more important to them than not doing it.  Where &quot;doing it&quot; well becomes a way of life.\r\nThe work we do is a reflection of who we are.  If we''re sloppy at it, it''s because we''re sloppy inside.  If we''re late, it''s because we''re late inside.  If we''re bored, we''re bored inside.\r\nThe most menial work can be a piece of art when done by an artist.\r\nSo the job here is not outside of ourselves, but inside of ourselves.\r\nMake sure they understand  the idea behind the work they''re being asked to do.  An idea more important than the work itself.\r\nEveryone who works here is expected to work towards being the best he can possibly be at the tasks he''s accountable for.  When he can''t do that, he should act like he is.  If unwilling to act, leave.\r\nA business is like a martial arts practice hall - a dojo - a place you go to practice being the best you can be.\r\nA game to be played in which the rules symbolize the idea you, the owner, have about the world.\r\nThe degree to which they buy into your game doesn''t depend on them but on how well you communicate the game to them - at the outset of the relationship - not after it''s begun.\r\nYour People Strategy is the way you communicate your idea.\r\n\r\n1. Never try to make a game out of what you want your people to do.  The game has to come first, what your people do comes second.  (?)\r\n2. Never create a game you''re unwilling to play yourself.\r\n3. Make sure there are ways of winning the game without ending it.  (never actually end it, but give occasional victories)\r\n4. Change the game from time to time : the tactics, not the strategy.  (any game can become boring, no matter how extraordinary it was. anticipate the end before anyone else does, and change it by executive action)\r\n5. Remind people of the game, constantly.  Once a week, have a meeting about the game.  Once a day, make some kind of issue about an exception to the way the game has been played, and make certain everyone knows about it.\r\n6. The game has to make sense.\r\n7. The game needs to be fun from time to time.  (not all the time)\r\n8. If you can''t think of a good game, steal one.\r\n\r\nThe hiring process is the first and most essential medium for communicating the Boss'' idea.\r\nHIRING:\r\n1. scripted presentation communicating the Boss'' idea in a group meeting to all the applicants at once.  describe the idea, history, successful experience implementing the idea, attributes required of the successful candidate for the position.\r\n2. meeting with each applicant individually to discuss reactions and feelings about the idea, as well as his background and experience. ask why they feel they''re great for the role in implementing the idea.\r\n3. notify successful candidate by phone.\r\n4. notify unsuccessful applicants, thanking for their interest.\r\n5. first day of training:\r\n - reviewing boss'' idea\r\n - summarizing the system\r\n - take a tour of facilities, highlighting people at work, systems at work, to demonstrate the interdependence of systems on people and people on systems\r\n - answering employee''s questions fully\r\n - give operations manual\r\n - review operations manual\r\n - completing employment papers\r\n\r\nDon''t hire experienced managers, because they''ll manage by standards they learned somewhere else.\r\nYou must take full accountability for what''s going on in your business.  You must lead the company in the direction you intend it to go.\r\nYou must set the standard.\r\nThe Management System : all managers  and future-managers are expected to produce results.\r\nYou don''t need professional managers to manage to those standards : just people who wish to learn how to manage them.  People who are personally committed to those standards as you are.\r\n\r\nYou need people who want to play your game. Not people who believe they have a better one.\r\n\r\nHierarchy of systems:  (where the &quot;it&quot; is the stated purpose of your business.)\r\n1 : how we do it here\r\n2 : how we recruit, hire, and train people to do it here\r\n3 : how we manage it here\r\n4 : how we change it here\r\n\r\n\r\n== MARKETING STRATEGY:\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to marketing, what you want is unimportant.  It''s what your customer wants that matters.\r\nWhat your customer wants is probably different that what he thinks he wants.\r\nMake a promise the customer wants to hear, then deliver on that promise better than anyone else on the block.\r\nThe COO is the driver of all of this.  The COO connects each part of the business process.  The COO maintains the integrity of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n== SYSTEMS STRATEGY:\r\n\r\nA system is a set of things, actions, ideas, and information that interact with each other, and in so doing, alter other systems.  (?)\r\n\r\nInformation is the glue that holds your system strategy together.  It tells you when and why you need to change.'),

How to manage every last itty bitty tiny thing in your life. Keep your inbox empty.', 'TWO KEY OBJECTIVES:\r\n1 - Capturing all things into a logical and trusted system\r\n2 - Make decisons about all the inputs you let into your life, so that you will always have a plan for next actions\r\n\r\nEveryone feels they have too much to handle, and not enough time to get it all done. Taking on more than they have resources to handle.\r\n\r\nWork : anything you want to be different than it currently is.\r\n\r\nHow much available data could be relevant to doing these projects &quot;better&quot;?  The answer is, an infinite amount, easily accessible through the web.\r\n\r\nWe''re allowing in huge amounts of information and communication from the outer world and generating an equally large volume of ideas and agreements with ourselves and others from our inner world.  A huge number of internal and external commitments.\r\n\r\nThe ability to be successful, relaxed, and in control during these fertile but terbulent times demands new ways of thinking and working.  There is a great need for new methods, technologies, and work habits to help us get on top of our world.\r\n\r\nYour ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax.\r\n\r\nClearing the mind and being flexible are key.\r\n\r\nAnything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does.\r\n\r\nMost of the stress people experience comes from inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept.\r\n\r\nLearn to control the &quot;open loops&quot;.\r\n\r\nMANAGING COMMITMENTS:\r\n1. If it''s on your mind, your mind isn''t clear.  Anything unfinished must be captured.\r\n2. Clarify exactly what your commitment is.\r\n3. Keep reminders of actions organized in a system you review regularly.\r\n\r\nWrite down the project or situation that is most on your mind at this moment.\r\nDescribe, in a single sentence, your intended succesful outcome for this problem or situation.\r\nWrite down the very next physical action required to move the situation forward.\r\n\r\nWHY THINGS ARE ON YOUR MIND:\r\nYou want it to be differently than it currently is, and yet:\r\n- you haven''t clarified exactly what the intended outcome is\r\n- you haven''t decided what the very next physical action step is\r\n- you haven''t put reminders of the outcome and the action required into a system you trust\r\n\r\nIt''s a waste of time and energy to keep thinking about something that you make no progress on.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.\r\n\r\nWe need to transform all the &quot;stuff&quot; we''re trying to organize into actionable stuff we need to do.\r\n\r\nGet in the habit of keeping nothing on your mind.\r\n\r\nYou can''t DO a project. You can only do an action related to it. Many actions require only a minute or two, in the appropriate context, to move a project forward.\r\n\r\nLack of time is not the major issue, though you may think it is. The real problem is a lack of clarity and definition about what a project really is, and what the associated next-action steps required are.  Clarifying things on the front end, when they first appear on the radar, rather than on the back end, after trouble has developed, allows people to reap the benefits of managing action.\r\n\r\nI capture and organize 100% of my stuff in and with objective tools at hand, not in my mind. That applies to everything - little or big - personal or professional - urgent or not.  Everything.\r\n\r\nYour mind will keep working on anything that''s still in that undecided state.\r\n\r\nSTAGES WE GO THROUGH AS WE DEAL WITH OUR WORK:\r\n- collect things\r\n- process what they mean and what to do about them\r\n- organize the results\r\n- review as options for what we choose to...\r\n- ... do\r\n\r\nCollect and gather together placeholders for all the things you consider incomplete in your world. Anything you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing.\r\n\r\nStuff --&gt; In Basket --&gt; What is it?\r\nIs it actionable?\r\n	YES:\r\n		What''s the next action?\r\n		Will it take less than 2 minutes?\r\n			YES: Do it now.\r\n			NO: Am I the right person to do this?\r\n				YES: Defer it (Keep track in Calendar or Next Actions)\r\n				NO: Delegate it. (Keep track in &quot;Waiting&quot;)\r\n	NO:\r\n		Reference  (retrievable when required)\r\n		Someday/Maybe\r\n		Trash it\r\n\r\nA project is any desired result that requires more than one action step.\r\n\r\nThe next-action decision is central. That action needs to be the next physical visible behavior, without exception, on every open loop.\r\n\r\nCALENDAR: every action that has to happen at a specific time or date.\r\nNEXT ACTIONS LIST: those that need to be done as soon as they can\r\nWAITING FOR: all you''re waiting for others to do\r\n\r\nSubdivide your Next Actions into categories, like Business Hours or With Assistant - so that next time you''re at a phone or with your assistant you can do them all at once.\r\n\r\nScan all the defined actions and options before you, radically increasing the efficacy of the choices you make about what you''re doing at any point in time.\r\n\r\nHow will you decide what to do and what not to do?  By trusting your intuition.\r\n\r\nWEEKLY REVIEW:\r\n- gather and process all your stuff\r\n- review your system\r\n- update your lists\r\n- get clean, clear, current, and complete\r\n\r\nBIG REVIEW:\r\n- life\r\n- 3-5 year vision\r\n- 1-2 year goals\r\n- areas of responsibility\r\n- current projects\r\n- current actions\r\n\r\nThing of your purpose. Think of what a successful outcome would look like.  Where would you be physically, financially, reputation-wise, or whatever?  Brainstorm potential steps. Organize your ideas. Decide on the next actions. Are you any clearer about where you want to go and how to get there?\r\n\r\nPeople love to win. If you''re not totally clear about the purpose of what you''re doing, you have no chance of winning.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF ANSWERING &quot;WHY&quot;:\r\n- creates decision-making criteria\r\n- aligns resources\r\n- motivates\r\n- clarifies focus\r\n- expands options, opens up creative thinking\r\n\r\nA great way to think about what your principles are, is to complete this sentence:\r\n&quot;I would give others totally free rein to do this, as long as they... &quot;\r\n\r\nYou won''t see how to do it until you see yourself doing it.\r\n\r\n1. View the project from beyond the completion date\r\n2. Envision wild success!  (Suspend &quot;yeah but...&quot;)\r\n3. Capture features, aspects, qualities you imagine in place\r\n\r\nAsking what specific physical action you''d take next, if you had nothing else to do, will test the maturity of your thinking about the project.\r\n\r\nA project is sufficiently planned for implementation when every next-action step has been decided on every front that can actually be moved on without some other components having to be completed first.  If the project has multiple components, each of them should be assessed by asking, &quot;Is there something that anyone could be doing on this right now?&quot;\r\n\r\nIn some cases, there will be only one aspect that can be activated, and everything else will depend on the results of that.\r\n\r\nThe highest-performing people I know are those who have installed the best tricks in their lives.\r\n\r\nEverything gets processed equally.  &quot;Process&quot; means decide what the thing is, what action is required, then dispatch it accordingly.\r\n\r\nEmergency scanning - looking for the most urgent, fun, or interesting stuff in your in box - is not processing.\r\n\r\nEmails are more efficient to process last-first because of all the discussion threads that accumulate on top of one another.\r\n\r\nYour CPA can provide record-retention timetables that will tell you how long you should keep what kinds of documentation.\r\n\r\nSOMEDAY/MAYBE : &quot;there''s nothing to do on this now, but there might be later&quot;.  An event in the future you''re not sure if you''ll be around for.  Something you''d rather sleep on it for a week.\r\n\r\nUntil you know what the next physical action is, there''s still more thinking required before anything can happen.\r\n\r\nDeciding isn''t really an action.  You just need more information before you can make a decision.  Is that information external sources or internal thinking?\r\n\r\nEven if the item is not high-priority, do it now if you''re ever going to do it at all.\r\n\r\nRecord the date on everything you hand-off to others.\r\n\r\nIf you put reference materials in the same pile as things you still want to read, you''ll go numb to the stack!\r\n\r\nYou''ll get a great feeling when you know that your &quot;Waiting For&quot; list is the complete inventory of everything you care about that other people are supposed to be doing.\r\n\r\nDon''t use support material for reminding!  You''ll go numb because they don''t prompt you to do anything.\r\n\r\nIf you have a project that you don''t really need to think about now, but deserves a flag at some point in the future, put it on your calendar.\r\n\r\nIf you have a list of calls you must make, the minute that list is not totally current with *all* the calls you need to make, your brain will not trust the system, and it won''t get relief from its lower-level mental tasks. It will have to take back the job of remembering and reminding, which as you know it doesn''t do very efficiently.\r\n\r\nReview the lists of all the actions you could possible do in your current context.\r\n\r\nEvaluate them against the flow of other work coming at you, to ensure that you make the best choices about what to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe weekly review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again.  Until you can honestly say, &quot;I absolutely know right now everything I''m not doing but could be doing if I decided to.&quot;\r\n\r\nAlways keep an inventory of things that need to be done that require very little mental or creative horsepower.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to increase your energy is to close some of your loops.  So always be sure to have some easy loops to close, right at hand.\r\n\r\nDo ad-hoc work as it shows up, not because it is the path of least resistance, but because it is the thing you need to do, vis-Ã¡-vis all the rest.\r\n\r\nAll of us could be doing more planning, more informally, and more often, about our projects and our lives.  If we did, it would relieve a lot of pressure on our psyches and produce an enormous amount of creative output with minimal effort.\r\n\r\nThe real need is to capture and utilize more of the creative, proactive thinking we do - or could do.\r\n\r\nI''m on a mission to make &quot;What''s the next action?&quot; part of the global thought process.\r\n\r\nIt would only require about 10 seconds of thinking to figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list.  But most people haven''t.\r\n\r\nBecause we procrastinate what we can imagine as being tedious, creative, sensitive, and intelligent people procrastinate the most because their sensitivity gives them the capability of producing lurid nightmare scenarios about all the negative consequences that might occur if it weren''t done perfectly!\r\n\r\nWho doesn''t procrastinate?  The insensitive oafs who just take something and start plodding forward, unaware of all the things that could go wrong.  Everyone else tends to get hung up about all kinds of things.\r\n\r\nTo many meetings end wiht a vague feeling that something ought to happen, and the hope that it''s not their personal job to make it so.\r\n\r\nGetting things going builds a more positive self-image than repeating affirmations in a mirror.\r\n\r\nIf it can be changed, there''s some action that will change it.  If it can''t, it must be considered part of the landscape to be incorporated in strategy and tactics.\r\n\r\nComplaining is a sign that someone isn''t willing to risk moving on a changeable situation, or won''t consider the immutable circumstance in his or her plans.  This is a temporary and hollow form of self-validation.\r\n\r\nWhen you start to make things happen, you really begin to believe you can make things happen.  And that makes things happen.\r\n\r\nThere are only two problems in life:\r\n(1) - you know what you want but don''t know how to get it\r\n... and / or ...\r\n(2) - you don''t know what you want\r\n\r\n&quot;Life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties, passing from one step of success to another, forming new wishes, and seeing them gratified.&quot; - Dr. Samuel Johnson'),

That''s it. If you can get past the first 20% of the book that just asks questions, the next 60% is quite good.', 'Bill Gates has said that if you took the twenty smartest people out of Microsoft it would be an insignificant company, and if you ask around the company what its core competency is, they donâ€™t say anything about software. They say itâ€™s hiring.\r\n\r\nThe ability to engage in cognitively complex forms of multivariate reasoning.\r\n\r\nIQ is a decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar task, but once a person has been at a job for a few years, IQ predicts little or nothing about performance.\r\n\r\nGeneral Electric CEO Jeff Immelt has been clear about what the company is looking for: someone who is externally focused, is a clear thinker, has imagination, is an inclusive leader, and is a confident expert. Those are behaviors, not traits.\r\n\r\nHe designed his practice to work on his specific needs.  Rice didnâ€™t need to do everything well, just certain things.  So he focused his practice work on exactly those requirements.\r\n\r\nBy age eighteen, the violinists in the first group had accumulated 7,410 hours of lifetime practice on average, versus 5,301 hours for violinists in the second group and 3,420 hours for those in the third group. All the differences were statistically significant.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performanceâ€ by Anders Ericsson\r\n\r\nThe differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.\r\n\r\nDeliberate practice can be applied in other domains, such as business or science, in which we almost never think about practicing.\r\n\r\nDeliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth examining.\r\n* - activity designed specifically to improve performance, often with a teacherâ€™s help\r\n* - it can be repeated a lot\r\n* - feedback on results is continuously available\r\n* - itâ€™s highly demanding mentally, or physically\r\n* - it isnâ€™t much fun.\r\n\r\nI was designing my own practice activity, even though itâ€™s clear that Iâ€™m completely unqualified to do so.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s almost always necessary for a teacher to design the activity best suited to improve an individualâ€™s performance.\r\n\r\nA business coach is looking at the same situations as a manager but can see, for example, that the manager systematically fails to communicate his intentions clearly.\r\n\r\nWithout a clear, unbiased view of the subjectâ€™s performance, choosing the best practice activity will be impossible.\r\n\r\nWhile the best methods of development are constantly changing, theyâ€™re always built around a central principle: Theyâ€™re meant to stretch the individual beyond his or her current abilities.\r\n\r\nDeliberate practice requires that one identify certain sharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved, and then work intently on them.\r\n\r\nGreat performers isolate remarkably specific aspects of what they do and focus on just those things until they are improved; then itâ€™s on to the next aspect.\r\n\r\nHigh repetition is the most important difference between deliberate practice of a task and performing the task for real, when it counts.\r\n\r\nSteve Kerr, former chief learning officer of Goldman Sachs and a highly respected researcher on leadership development.\r\n\r\nPracticing without feedback is like bowling through a curtain that hangs down to knee level. You can work on technique all you like, but if you canâ€™t see the effects, two things will happen: You wonâ€™t get any better, and youâ€™ll stop caring.\r\n\r\nDeliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration.\r\n\r\n4-5 hours a day seems to be the upper limit of deliberate practice, and this is frequently accomplished in sessions lasting no more than 60-90 minutes.\r\n\r\nDoing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and thatâ€™s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what weâ€™re good at, we insistently seek out what weâ€™re not good at. Then we identify the painful, difficult activities that will make us better and do those things over and over. After each repetition, we force ourselves to see - or get others to tell us - exactly what still isnâ€™t right so we can repeat the most painful and difficult parts of what weâ€™ve just done.\r\n\r\nWhen we see great performers doing what they do, it strikes us that theyâ€™ve practiced for so long, and done it so many times, they can just do it automatically. But in fact, what they have achieved is the ability to avoid doing it automatically.\r\n\r\nGreat performers never allow themselves to reach the automatic, arrested-development stage in their chosen field. That is the effect of continual deliberate practice - avoiding automaticity. The essence of practice, which is constantly trying to do the things one cannot do comfortably, makes automatic behavior impossible.\r\n\r\nEveryone in these studies is hearing the same things, but through years of practice, some are perceiving more. The relevance of these findings for business seems obvious. Specifically, we can abstract from the research a few ways, directly applicable in business, that top performers perceive more.  They understand the significance of indicators that average performers donâ€™t even notice.\r\n\r\nSam Walton found an innovative way to gauge customer satisfaction. He realized that the best indicator of how happy his customers were was to measure how happy his employees were; the way managers treated the employees was the way employees would treat the customers.\r\n\r\nLaura Rittenhouse, an unusual type of financial analyst, counts the number of times the word I occurs in annual letters to shareholders from corporate CEOs, contending that this and other evidence in the letters helps predict company performance (basic finding: Egomaniacs are bad news).\r\n\r\nMuch of the power of looking further ahead comes from the simple act of raising oneâ€™s gaze and getting a new perspective, and doing it not once or occasionally, but using practice principles to do it often and get better at it. When was the last time you, in your working role, participated in a deep discussion about the state of your business five years from now? How about fifteen years from now, including a look at the future of your businessâ€™s environment, competitors, regulators, and other factors? Such discussions rarely happen below the level of the CEO, yet the experience of excellent performers suggests they offer advantages for everyone.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of companies, many of them in biotechnology or infotech, with no profits and no prospect of profits anytime soon, yet with considerable share prices. Investors are valuing these companies by looking years into the future.\r\n\r\nThe future always counts, and looking further into it - rationally - is always an advantage.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a matter of seeing black versus seeing five shades of black, and it works in evaluating people, situations, proposals, performances, products, or anything else. In each case, seeing differences that others donâ€™t see is another way of perceiving more.\r\n\r\nComparing world-class players with good club-level players.  What made them better?  They had more knowledge about their field.\r\n\r\nMany companies work hard to give their top performers the widest possible knowledge by assigning them to many jobs that are different in nature and location - operating jobs, staff jobs, all around the world - and in this way the top performers have typically learned several, and sometimes all, of the most important parts of the business.\r\n\r\nEndurance runners have larger than average hearts, an attribute that most of us see as one of the natural advantages with which they were blessed. But no, research has shown that their hearts grow after years of intensive training; when they stop training, their hearts revert toward normal size.\r\n\r\nBecause the demands of achieving exceptional performance are so great over so many years, no one has a prayer of meeting them without utter commitment. Youâ€™ve got to know what you want to do, not suspect it or be inclined toward it or be thinking about it.\r\n\r\nExperienced masters in our field who can advise us on the skills and abilities we need to acquire next, and can give us feedback on how weâ€™re doing.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin: He found examples of prose clearly superior to anything he could produce.  Making brief notes on the meaning of each sentence: a few days later he would take up the notes and try to express the meaning of each sentence in his own words. When done, he compared his essay with the original, â€œdiscovered some of my faults, and corrected them.â€ Franklin realized also that a key element of a good essay is its organization, so he developed a method to work on that. He would again make short notes on each sentence in an essay, but would write each note on a separate slip of paper. He would then mix up the notes and set them aside for weeks, until he had forgotten the essay. At that point he would try to put the notes in their correct order, attempt to write the essay, and then compare it with the original; again, he â€œdiscovered many faults and amended them.â€ Franklin identified the aspects of his performance that needed to be improved and found a way to stretch himself, the essential core of deliberate practice. Significantly, he did not try to become a better essay writer by sitting down and writing essays. Instead, like a top-ranked athlete or musician, he worked over and over on those specific aspects that needed improvement.\r\n\r\nFor spoken presentations: Watch a presentation that you consider especially well done and make notes of its various points; later, after youâ€™ve forgotten most of it, use your notes to create a talk making the same points; deliver the talk and record it; then compare your video with the original.\r\n\r\nChess: Study a particular position and choose the move you would make, then compare it with the move chosen by the master; if theyâ€™re different, figure out why and which is better.\r\n\r\nThe chess model has been used widely in business education: the case method. Pioneered at the Harvard Business School, it is strongly analogous to chess practice: Youâ€™re presented with a problem, and your job is to figure out a solution. Real life being the way it is, you often wonâ€™t know whether the solution chosen by the caseâ€™s protagonist was the best one possible, or whether yours was any better. But the process of focusing on the problem and evaluating proposed solutions is powerfully instructive.\r\n\r\nCases: students at the Harvard Business School study more than five hundred of them during the two-year program.\r\n\r\nConditioning can also be practiced with new material. Analyze the basic ratios in an unfamiliar financial statement with pen and paper, even though you have software that could do it all with one click. Do a value-based analysis of a stock. Pencil-edit a magazine article. You wonâ€™t be learning new skills; youâ€™ll be building the strengths that make all your skills possible.\r\n\r\nPractice by yourself through the fast-growing world of business simulations. Itâ€™s quite amazing whatâ€™s available. Web-based or downloadable simulation games in marketing, stock trading, negotiating, corporate strategizing, and many other disciplines at several levels of sophistication are widely available.\r\n\r\nThe best performers set goals that are not about the outcome but about the process of reaching the outcome.\r\n\r\nThe best performers make the most specific, technique-oriented plans. Theyâ€™re thinking of exactly, not vaguely, how to get to where theyâ€™re going.\r\n\r\nWhen a customer raises a completely unexpected problem in a deal negotiation, an excellent businessperson can pause mentally and observe his or her own mental processes as if from outside: Have I fully understood whatâ€™s really behind this objection? Am I angry? Am I being hijacked by my emotions? Do I need a different strategy here? What should it be?\r\n\r\nChoose a comparison that stretches you just beyond your current limits. Research confirms what common sense tells us, that too high a standard is discouraging and not very instructive, while too low a standard produces no advancement.\r\n\r\nMake domain knowledge a direct objective rather than a byproduct of work. Set a goal of becoming an expert on your business.\r\n\r\nIf you know too much about a situation, a business, a field of study, then you canâ€™t have the flash of insight that is available only to someone unburdened by a lifetime of immersion in the domain.\r\n\r\nToo much experience within a field may restrict creativity because you know so well how things should be done that you are unable to escape to come up with new ideas.\r\n\r\nHigh creative achievement and intrinsic motivation go together. Creative people are focused on the task (How can I solve this problem?) and not on themselves (What will solving this problem do for me?).');

And never the twain shall meet.\r\n\r\nWhen you''re meeting with someone, turn off the device so you can focus on that person completely.\r\n\r\nTry changing each trigger, one at a time. So if you go to check your blogs first thing in the morning, make it a new habit to not open your browser, and instead open a simple text editor and start writing.\r\n\r\nStart your day in quiet, before the busy-ness of the world intrudes on your peace of mind.\r\n\r\nBegin your work day by listing your three Most Important Tasks.  Start immediately on the top task.  Single-task on this important task as long as you can -- ideally until it''s done. Now you''ve started your day with focus, and you''ve already accomplished something great.\r\n\r\nEvery hour or two, do a refocus ritual.\r\n25 minutes of focus + 5 minutes of rest.\r\nWork disconnected for 45 minutes and connect for 15 minutes. You get the idea -- it''s almost as if the connected period is a reward for doing good, focused work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimit your stream to only the most essential information and communications, and you''ll free up hours of time for creating and doing amazing things.\r\n\r\nStart from scratch. Assume that nothing is sacred, empty your plate, and only put back on it what you absolutely need or love.\r\n\r\nAdmit to yourself: you can''t read and consume everything. You can''t do everything,\r\n\r\nChoose what you''ll do and read and respond to, and let the rest go. Let the rest go. This is unbelievably important. You have to accept this, and be OK with it.\r\n\r\nAre you afraid people will think you''re rude? Are you afraid you''ll miss something? Are you afraid you''ll lose customers?\r\n\r\nThis obsession with keeping up with information takes away from the things that are most important to us. But we try to keep up because we''re afraid: we might miss something important, and seem ignorant we might miss out on an opportunity we might not see something bad that we need to respond to.\r\n\r\nRemember that urges are only temporary. If you are aware that you''re feeling an urge, you can ride it like a wave -- it''ll surge and get stronger, and then fade away. Take some deep breaths, and replace the habit with another habit.\r\n\r\nWhenever you find yourself dreading something, procrastinating, forcing yourself and hating it, stop and ask yourself why. There must be a reason -- you''ll never sustain any action for long if you hate doing it. Change course to something you''re more excited about,\r\n\r\nAnticipate the difficult by managing the easy. Another famous quote by Lao Tzu, it''s timeless and wise. If you can manage the easy, small things now, you''ll save yourself the time and effort of having to do the difficult things later.\r\n\r\nWhile many people will say that striving for something new is a good thing, that we should always be striving, unfortunately it means we''re never satisfied.\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens once wrote, &quot;He did each single thing as if he did nothing else.&quot;\r\n\r\nYour Most Important Task list. These should be extremely important tasks that will have a high-impact on your life. Don''t do anything else before doing the first thing on this short list.\r\n\r\nMulti-projecting can work -- you get one project going, but while you''re waiting on something, you can switch to a second or even third project. All the time, you''re only working on one task at a time, until each task is done, however.\r\n\r\nDo note that there''s a danger in taking on too many projects at once. I''d suggest taking on as few projects as possible. If you can do only one project at a time, without getting stuck in waiting, then do that -- it''s much more effective and you''ll get your projects done much faster. But when you must wait, you can switch to a second project.\r\n\r\nThe best art is created in solitude, for good reason: it''s only when we are alone that we can reach into ourselves and find truth, beauty, soul.\r\n\r\n&quot;Just in case&quot; is a place in the space time continuum that invokes clutter.\r\n\r\nDon''t keep things in your workspace just in case, don''t buy things just in case. The future is a mystery, let it remain that way.\r\n\r\n-- QUOTES:\r\n\r\n&quot;Most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you''ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, ''Is this necessary?''&quot; â€“ Marcus Aurelius\r\n\r\n&quot;Without great solitude no serious work is possible.&quot; â€“ Pablo Picasso\r\n\r\nNikola Tesla: &quot;The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude.
